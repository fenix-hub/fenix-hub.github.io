## 📖 About Me
1997, Automation Engineer.  
  
From *Isaac Asimov* to *Masamune Shirow*, from the ethics behind *artificial intelligence* to the dirty and raw *cyberpunk*, the worlds of computer science and robotics have always fascinated me.  
  
I'm mainly interested in contributing to open-source projects and frameworks.  
I enjoy developing tools that could help other users and developers all around the world.
